This repo is for my website, which is based on the static page generator, Hugo, utilizing the theme Hugo-Coder.

It serves as a place for me to publically track how the site is created, managed, and coded, as well as give a glipse behind the curtain.

I ultimately chose not to dive too deep in template creation because this is not a set of skills in which i have proficiency. I may dive into it in the future, but for now, i am content using a template.
