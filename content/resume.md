# Work History
For a comprehensive work history, please take a look at my LinkedIn.

[LinkedIn CV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-romero-2359b140/)

I have been in the workforce for nearly 20 years. I started as a sweeper, cleaning elementry school at the age of 14, and have work a variety of jobs in that time. You might be shocked to see so many in my full CV - Ski instructor, Emergency Medical Technician, and Radio Producer to name a few - But technology has always been my passion. Many of the roles i have were in service of attending college, until i landed my first Software Testing role and began my Engineering career. I refused to take out hefty loans.

## Career Highlights and the lessons learned

1. Machinist Assistant and Operator (summers of 2016 and 2017) - During high school, i worked over the summers at a machine shop. I was exposed to math and coding in the physical world. G-Code is the language of machines, and instructs CNC machines to create beautiful creations through Trigonometry, Algebra, and Calculus. I learned how to read code watching the line by line commands given to a machine, and how to quickly respond to errors and troubleshooting.
2. Ski Instructor (Winters of 2014-2018) - This is where I learned my love of teaching. Starting as a 14 year old "peer" instructor I came into my own as an regualr instrucrtor. I grew to love the teaching process, and the importance of explaining, demonstrating, and guiding.
3. Emergency Medical Technician - Mine Rescue and Ambulance worker (latter half of 2008, 2011-2012) - Being an Emergency worker turns the volumn of your life down. You see people in the worst situation, as noone usually calls an ambulance when things are going well. I learned to think in crisis and to think on my feet. I also learned to trust instincts based on training, repetition, and judgement. If it weren't for horrifically low pay, I would have made a career of this line of work. The last call I ever recieved working an ambulance was delivering a baby - A romantic and symbolic end to my career. Please feel free to ask me about it - it is a good story, and a happy memory.
4. Radio Producer - (2011-2014) - While working for Clear Channel (now iHeartMedia), I learned a love of art, music, and communication. I learned that how you say things matters, and that tone sents moods. I also learned a love a media in the form of broadcasting, video, and photography
5. Software Tester () - I always had a passion for technology, especially operations as I ran home servers running old Windows 2003 and Windows 2008 servers, but it wasn't until I was a software tester that development became a love of mine. With the mentorship of a manager, I developed features, worked on automation, and learned the joy of code.
