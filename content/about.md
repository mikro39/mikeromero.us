My name is **Michael Romero**, and I am a Site Reliability, Systems, and DevOps Engineer and Architect with a passion for complex systems. 

I run an enterprise homelab where i tinker with GitOps, develop applications, play with AI, and host servers for friends and video games. I enjoy what technology has to offer, and find satisfaction in great, reliabile systems.  

It is more important to know more than just technology to be an architect of reliability, and this is something I take to heart. From studying art and literature, to delving into mechanical engineering and the art of road building, software and hardware systems can learn a lot from traditional fields. You'll find me deep into a variety of books ranging from Software development, science, world affairs, and engineering, to the great works of fiction and nonfiction that we are lucky to have such access to.

While I have no degree, I have studied at BYU Idaho and Western Governors University in Computer Science, Salt Lake Community College for Shipping Logistics, and the United States Army in Forign Relations and Leadership. The world is my school, and I have found it is more important to show what you have learned than to focus on where a piece of paper is from.

For my accoplishments, I have built several Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams, trained individuals on SRE principals, and performed various cloud Lift and Shifts. I have also served the US as a Korean Linguist, lived overseas as a service missionary to the nation of South Korea, and volunteered on the board of the MS Societies MS 150 Bike Tour in Utah. I am also an accomplished Photographer and Videographer, Outdoorsman and Mountaineer,  and cyclist.
