# On Leadership

In this article, I am hoping to illustrate the point of what makes a leader good, and what makes a leader bad. I know that, often, I try to keep my humilty on the subject. Who in their right mind want to declair that they know better than those that are in higher postions. Who wants to fight that fight? And who isn't keenly aware of the Dunning Kruger Effect when they start to think they know better?

But I have seen a lot of leaders in my time, and honestly, many of them are not good. So have hearts of gold, but lack conviction. Others shoulder too much. Some view life as a game, and everyone around them as gristle for the meat grinder of their success. Some are just clueless as to how nepatism, or status got them where they are. Good leaders are honestly quite rare. Not because of a lack of eligible leaders, but because we have to face a fact in our society. Toxicity in the workplace is considered acceptable by our leaders.

In this post, though, I am conflicted. I don't really think it can be fixed. A "Meritocracy" I think is honestly unrealistic, and unprobable. Humilty struggles to accept its brilliance, and honestly, is often displaced by the wave of arrogant ineptitude.

## Dread

Its a day that I dread. A day where I have to give a demo on something that I have made. A solution to solve an issue at the client's site.

I don't dread this day because the client is hard, or that i am giving a potentially incorrect solution. I dread this presentation, because my manager is there.

It's because I think they are a bad person. We have good conversations, and get along well enough. They are friendly, and cheerful when things are going well enough. And they are experienced in technology, and somethimes I even consult with them on what is going on, and how we are getting along.

No, it is because I know, in this meeting, they will do the worst trait of someone who thinks they are a leader, but have never led in a high stakes situation. They will second guess my solution, and send me into a defensive state when we are presenting to a client. A well meaning sabotage that they will not realize they are doing.

And not 10 minutes into the meeting it starts. And we look like fools. We've lost a battle we didn't know we were fighting and the client things we are fools.

## What is Leadership

Good heavens, the Meme worth nature of that statement. "Leadership is ..." is basically the corporate pickup artists phishing technique to aspiring MBA graduates. "Leadership is about action" "Leadership is when you set an example"

leadership, leadership, leadership. The solutions to all of your problems and instructions on how you can be rich, famous, and buy a yacht. Supposidly, it helps you increase yopur status, and give you the title that will allow you to ignore your family and think about only yourself. But the hard truth is, good leadership is not about status.

It's about humility, and knowledge of a wide assorment of subjects, but without the inhibition of specialization in any one area. It's about accepting your limitations, and embracing the special knowledge of the team you lead. In the army, I learned a lot, and was privleged to have great leaders. Someone who is a good Sergeant isn't someone who tells you how to do your job.
