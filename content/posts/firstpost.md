# What Post to be First
This is the first post i have made on my fancy new page. So why do i have so many place to read from me? Well, it is a formality question really.

This page is my personal website, where i will talk in a vaccume. Sometimes the subject will be on things other than technology, for example, this post. For this, i am writing about why i made a site on top of my substack, and on top of my other social media. I might also rant on things like leadership, or pre substack posts, or even make comments on how i host things, or where i get photos for my content. Or even mention my several ellusive YouTube channels.

Ultimately, this is a code driven blog, meant to be overly complicated for what it is. After all, it is a static site, generated using Hugo and a written in VS Code.
